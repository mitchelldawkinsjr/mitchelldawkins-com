In 2003, my father, **Dr Eld. Mitchell L. Dawkins Sr.**, founded the *WARNER CHAPEL OUTREACH MINISTRY, INC.* while pastoring a small Southern Baptist church on the west side of Winter Park, Florida—an area often overlooked and underserved. His mission was simple yet profound: to create real, lasting impact in a community that needed hope, resources, and love.

He believed deeply that when God blesses you, you are called to bless others. That principle became the heartbeat of his ministry, and it’s the legacy we carry forward today.

## What Legacy Means to Us

Legacy isn’t just about inheritance—it’s about intention. It’s about building something that outlives you, something that continues to serve, uplift, and empower long after you’re gone.

For our family, legacy means:

- **Faith in action**: Serving others as an expression of our beliefs
- **Generational purpose**: Continuing the work our fathers began
- **Community investment**: Meeting tangible needs with compassion and consistency

## The 2023 Transition: From Ministry to Foundation

After my father’s passing, the outreach ministry paused. My mother, who had been the director, faced health challenges that made it difficult to continue. In 2023, my cousin **Nick Dawkins** and I came together to reimagine the future of our family’s mission.

Nick, a standout offensive lineman at Penn State and a passionate community leader, approached me with a vision: to evolve the ministry into a formal nonprofit that could scale its impact. Together, we launched the **Dawkins Family Foundation**, honoring our father’s legacy while expanding our reach.

## Our Mission Today

At the Dawkins Family Foundation, we believe every child and teen deserves a chance to thrive and succeed in their academic and professional lives. Our mission is to empower young minds with the knowledge and skills they need to unlock their full potential.

We focus on:

- **Educational empowerment**: Tutoring, mentorship, and scholarships
- **Youth development**: Leadership training and life skills workshops
- **Community support**: Resource drives and local partnerships

## The 3 E’s: Education, Empower, Excel

Our guiding pillars—Education, Empower, and Excel—represent the foundation of our work:

- **Education**: We believe education is the gateway to opportunity. We provide tools, tutoring, workshops, and scholarships to help young people grow in knowledge and confidence.

- **Empower**: Beyond academics, we nurture leadership, critical thinking, and resilience. Our programs aim to cultivate empowered youth who see their value and use their voice.

- **Excel**: We challenge every participant to not just meet expectations—but to exceed them. Excellence is the standard, and we build pathways to achievement through mentorship, support, and accountability.

## Where We Serve

Our work spans multiple regions, reflecting both our roots and our growth:

- **Central Flordia**: Continuing the original mission in our hometown
- **West Michigan**: Addressing local needs in underserved communities
- **Lehigh Valley Pennsylvania**: Supporting youth through scholarships and programs

## The Work Is Personal

This foundation is an amalgamation of my life’s journey—blending the heart of community service instilled by my father with the skills and experiences I’ve gained in the professional world. It’s about leveraging technology, strategy, and compassion to make a tangible difference.

## What's Next

We’re excited to announce upcoming initiatives, including:

- **Scholarship programs**: Providing financial support to deserving students
