## Introduction Section

The GH Film Review Pipeline is a comprehensive data processing system designed to transform raw football game film data into professional-grade reports, dashboards, and analytics. Built for coaching staff and sports analysts, this pipeline automates the entire process from CSV data ingestion to report generation, providing consistent, data-driven player evaluations.

**Status: Completed** â€” The pipeline is fully functional and has been successfully used for multiple seasons of player evaluation. The system processes weekly game data and generates comprehensive reports automatically.

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

Football coaching staff face significant challenges when analyzing player performance:

- **Manual data entry** from game film is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Inconsistent scoring** across different evaluators and games  
- **Limited analytics** beyond basic statistics
- **No standardized reporting** format for player development tracking
- **Difficulty comparing players** across different positions and roles
- **Time-intensive report generation** that takes hours of manual work

### The Solution

This pipeline addresses these challenges through comprehensive automation:

1. **Automated data processing** - CSV files are cleaned, standardized, and validated automatically
2. **Custom scoring system** - Sophisticated rubrics for consistent player evaluation
3. **Advanced metrics calculation** - Beyond basic stats with normalized performance indicators
4. **Professional report generation** - Individual player PDFs, weekly summaries, and group reports
5. **Interactive dashboards** - HTML-based player comparisons and analytics
6. **Season-long tracking** - Comprehensive player development over time
7. **Automated deployment** - GitHub Actions for seamless updates

## Technical Implementation

The system architecture follows a modular pipeline approach:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**
  - CSV file processing and validation
  - Data cleaning and standardization
  - Error handling and logging

- **Processing Layer**
  - Custom scoring algorithms
  - Advanced metrics calculation
  - Data normalization and comparison

- **Output Generation**
  - PDF report creation with ReportLab
  - HTML dashboard generation
  - Static site compilation

- **Deployment Layer**
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD
  - Automated GitHub Pages deployment
  - Google Analytics integration

## Key Features

### Automated Scoring System

The pipeline implements a sophisticated scoring rubric that evaluates players on multiple dimensions:

**Positive Plays:**
- Touchdown: +15 points
- Relentless Effort: +5 points
- Elite Route: +7 points
- Good Route: +2 points
- Catch/Rush yardage: +0.5 per yard
- Broken Tackles: +1.0 per tackle
- Good Block: +2 points
- Pancake Block: +10 points
- First Down: +5 points
- Spectacular Catch: +10 points

**Negative Plays:**
- Missed Assignment: -10 points
- Dropped Pass: -15 points
- Bad Route: -2 points
- Loaf: -2 points
- Not Full Speed: -3 points
- Whiffed Block: -1 point

### Advanced Analytics

The system calculates sophisticated metrics that provide deeper insights:

- **Catch Rate** = catches / (catches + drops)
- **Drop Rate** = drops / (catches + drops)
- **Yards per Target** = (rec_yards + rush_yards) / targets
- **TDs per 30** = (touchdowns / snaps) * 30
- **Targets per 30** = (targets / snaps) * 30
- **Key Plays per 30** = (key_plays / snaps) * 30

### Professional Report Generation

The pipeline generates multiple output formats:

- **Individual Player Reports** - Detailed text analysis for each player
- **Weekly Summary PDFs** - Coaching staff overview with key insights
- **Group Film PDFs** - Aggregated play-by-play details
- **HTML Dashboards** - Interactive player comparisons
- **Snapshot Tables** - Quick weekly overviews
- **Season Dashboards** - Long-term player development tracking

### Batch Processing

The system can process entire seasons with a single command:

```bash
# Process all weeks automatically
for d in out/Wk*; do
  # Grade and generate reports for each week
  ./venv/bin/python film_grade.py "$prep" --out_dir "$d"
  # Create PDFs and dashboards
  ./venv/bin/python tools/make_pdfs.py --reports_dir "$d/reports"
done
```
