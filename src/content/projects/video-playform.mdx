## Introduction Section

The Video Processing Platform is a scalable, multi-tenant system currently under active development. This innovative solution is designed to help both organizations and individuals extract maximum value from their video content. Built with enterprise-grade security and isolation, the platform enables businesses, content creators, public speakers, educators, and other professionals to process videos, generate transcriptions, train custom AI models, and extract actionable insights - all within a secure environment that scales with their needs.

**Status: Under Development** - This project is currently in MVP phase with core functionality being implemented and tested. Expected beta release in Q3 2025.

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

A diverse range of users - from large organizations to individual content creators - accumulate vast libraries of video content. This includes corporate training materials, webinars, YouTube videos, podcast recordings, lectures, keynote speeches, and internal communications. However, this valuable content often remains underutilized due to:

- **Difficult searchability** - Finding specific information within videos is time-consuming

## Technical Implementation

The platform leverages several key technologies:

### Infrastructure & Isolation

Docker containers provide tenant isolation with resource allocation controlled by the TenantContainerManager, ensuring security and performance based on subscription tier.

```python
class TenantContainerManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.docker_client = docker.from_env()
        self.config = config
        
    def create_tenant_container(self, tenant_id, tier="basic"):
        # Resource allocation based on tier
        resources = self.get_resources_for_tier(tier)
        
        # Create isolated container for tenant
        container = self.docker_client.containers.run(
            "video-processor-base:latest",
            name=f"tenant-{tenant_id}",
            detach=True,
            environment={
                "TENANT_ID": tenant_id,
                "API_KEY": self.generate_api_key(tenant_id)
            },
            mem_limit=resources["memory"],
            cpu_count=resources["cpu"],
            volumes={
                f"/data/tenants/{tenant_id}": {
                    "bind": "/data", 
                    "mode": "rw"
                }
            },
            network="tenant-network"
        )
        
        return container.id
```

### Video Processing

The platform uses a combination of FFmpeg for video/audio manipulation and the Whisper API for transcription:

```python
class VideoProcessor:
    def process_video(self, video_id, tenant_id):
        # Download video from S3
        video_path = self.download_from_s3(video_id, tenant_id)
        
        # Extract audio using FFmpeg
        audio_path = self.extract_audio(video_path)
        
        # Transcribe audio using Whisper API
        transcription = self.transcribe_audio(audio_path)
        
        # Store results
        self.store_transcription(video_id, transcription)
        self.update_video_status(video_id, "processed")
        
        return transcription
```

### Model Training

The platform includes a sophisticated model training pipeline using Hugging Face Transformers, alongside a RAG implementation for immediate insights:

```python
class VideoModelTrainer:
    def train_model(self, model_id, tenant_id):
        # Prepare training data from transcriptions
        training_data = self.prepare_training_data(tenant_id)
        
        # Fine-tune base model
        model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")
        trainer = Trainer(
            model=model,
            args=TrainingArguments(
                output_dir=f"/data/models/{model_id}",
                per_device_train_batch_size=8,
                num_train_epochs=3
            ),
            train_dataset=training_data
        )
        
        # Start training
        trainer.train()
        
        # Save and upload model
        self.save_model(model, model_id, tenant_id)
        self.update_model_status(model_id, "trained")

class RAGProcessor:
    def __init__(self, embeddings_model="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"):
        self.embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=embeddings_model)
        self.vector_store = None
        
    def create_knowledge_base(self, transcriptions, tenant_id):
        # Process transcriptions into chunks
        text_chunks = self.process_transcriptions(transcriptions)
        
        # Create vector store from chunks
        self.vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(
            texts=text_chunks,
            embedding=self.embeddings
        )
        
        # Save vector store for tenant
        self.save_vector_store(tenant_id)
        
    def query(self, question, tenant_id, top_k=3):
        # Load tenant's vector store
        self.load_vector_store(tenant_id)
        
        # Retrieve relevant documents
        docs = self.vector_store.similarity_search(question, k=top_k)
        
        # Generate answer using retrieved context
        llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")
        qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
            llm=llm,
            retriever=self.vector_store.as_retriever()
        )
        
        return qa_chain.run(question)
