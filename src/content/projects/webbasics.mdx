## Introduction Section

CodeMentor IDE is a lightweight, fully offline web development environment designed specifically for teaching front-end technologies in challenging environments. Born from my experience teaching coding in detention centers and other resource-limited settings, this tool addresses the critical need for accessible programming education regardless of technical constraints. Built as a Chrome extension with locally-bundled CodeMirror libraries, it provides a distraction-free coding experience with syntax highlighting, real-time preview, and complete offline functionality.

**Status: Completed** - This project has been fully implemented and is ready for use in educational environments, including those with severe resource limitations. It continues to receive updates based on instructor feedback from diverse teaching contexts.

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

This project was born from my direct experience teaching web development in severely resource-constrained environments, including detention centers. These challenging teaching situations revealed critical limitations in existing tools:

- **Restricted or non-existent internet** - Most detention facilities and similar environments prohibit or severely limit internet access for security reasons
- **Limited software installation privileges** - Many institutional computers restrict software installation, making standard IDEs unusable
- **Highly variable technical infrastructure** - Computing resources can be outdated, inconsistent, or subject to strict security policies
- **Need for distraction minimization** - Students in these environments benefit from focused tools without excessive features that can overwhelm beginners
- **Intermittent access to learning resources** - Students often have limited and scheduled computer time, requiring tools that work instantly without setup

Beyond these specialized environments, similar challenges exist in many educational settings:

- **Internet dependency** - Most online coding platforms require constant internet access
- **Distraction-filled interfaces** - Many coding environments include unnecessary features that can overwhelm beginners
- **Installation complexity** - Full-featured IDEs often have complex setup requirements
- **Limited accessibility** - Many classrooms and training environments have restricted internet access
- **Inconsistent experience** - Web-based platforms can behave differently across devices

### The Solution

CodeMentor IDE addresses these challenges through a focused approach:

1. **Fully offline functionality** - Bundles the complete CodeMirror library for syntax highlighting without internet
2. **Chrome extension deployment** - Simple installation with no complex setup requirements
3. **Distraction-free interface** - Clean, minimal UI focused on learning core web technologies
4. **Separate editing tabs** - Dedicated areas for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to reinforce separation of concerns
5. **Real-time preview** - Immediate rendering to help students visualize their code's output
6. **Consistent experience** - Works identically across all devices with Chrome browser support
7. **Portable learning** - Students can work on their projects anywhere, even without internet

## Technical Implementation

CodeMentor IDE is built with a focus on simplicity and reliability:

### Extension Architecture

The project uses a straightforward Chrome extension structure:

- **manifest.json** - Defines extension properties and permissions
- **popup.html/js** - Simple launcher interface to open the editor
- **index.html** - Main editor interface with tabs and preview
- **Bundled CodeMirror** - Complete library included for offline functionality

```javascript
// Initializing the CodeMirror editors with syntax highlighting
let editors = {
    html: CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById("html-code"), {
        mode: "htmlmixed",
        theme: "default",
        lineNumbers: true
    }),
    css: CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById("css-code"), {
        mode: "css",
        theme: "default",
        lineNumbers: true
    }),
    js: CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById("js-code"), {
        mode: "javascript",
        theme: "default",
        lineNumbers: true
    })
};
```

### Tab-Based Interface

The editor implements a clean tab system to help students understand the separation between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```javascript
function switchTab(tab) {
    Object.keys(editors).forEach(key => {
        editors[key].getWrapperElement().style.display = (key === tab) ? "block" : "none";
    });
}
```

### Live Preview Functionality

A key educational feature is the real-time preview that renders the combined code:

```javascript
function runCode() {
    let html = editors.html.getValue();
    let css = `<style>${editors.css.getValue()}</style>`;
    let js = `<script>${editors.js.getValue()}<\/script>`;
    document.getElementById("preview").srcdoc = html + css + js;
}
```

## Key Features

### Fully Offline Functionality

The extension bundles all necessary CodeMirror libraries locally, ensuring complete functionality without internet access:

- Core CodeMirror library
- Syntax highlighting modules for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Theme files for consistent styling
- No external CDN dependencies

### Tab-Based Editing Experience

The interface separates code into dedicated tabs:

- **HTML Tab** - For structure and content
- **CSS Tab** - For styling and design
- **JavaScript Tab** - For behavior and interactivity

This separation reinforces proper web development practices and helps beginners understand the distinct roles of each technology.

### Live Preview Panel

The integrated preview panel renders the combined code in real-time:

- Preview updates on demand with the "Run" button
- Full implementation for proper rendering when js in use page opens in new tab
- Realistic view of how code would appear in a browser
